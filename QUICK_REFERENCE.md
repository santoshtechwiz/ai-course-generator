# Quick Reference: CourseDetails Bug Fixes & Cleanup

## 🔴 CRITICAL BUG - NOW FIXED ✅

**Problem**: Progress showing "0 Completed" despite database having records

**Root Cause**: Type mismatch in `useUnifiedProgress.ts` line 88
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG
.map((id) => Number(id))        // Was converting to Numbers

// ✅ FIXED
.map((id) => String(id))        // Now keeps as Strings
```

**Files Changed**: 2
- ✅ `hooks/useUnifiedProgress.ts`
- ✅ `app/.../context/CourseModuleContext.tsx`

---

## 📋 Deleted Files (NEXT)

### DELETE IMMEDIATELY
```
hooks/VideoPlayerSection.tsx       376 lines - Not a component!
hooks/ProgressSection.tsx          163 lines - Not a component!
Total: 539 lines to delete
```

## 🔗 Key Data Flow

```
1. Database (ChapterProgress table)
   ↓
2. API /api/progress/:courseId
   └─ Returns: { completedChapters: [1,2,3] }
   ↓
3. useCourseProgressSync
   └─ Dispatches to Redux with Strings ["1","2","3"]
   ↓
4. Redux Store
   └─ Stores: { completedChapters: ["1","2","3"] }
   ↓
5. useUnifiedProgress (NOW FIXED ✅)
   └─ Returns Strings: ["1","2","3"]
   ↓
6. CourseModuleContext
   └─ Provides: { completedChapters: ["1","2","3"] }
   ↓
7. ChapterPlaylist Component
   └─ Displays: "3 Completed, 2 Remaining" ✅
```

## 🚨 IMPORTANT Notes

1. **Type Consistency**: All chapter IDs must be Strings throughout the system
2. **No More Conversions**: Don't convert Numbers↔Strings in middle of flow
3. **Delete VideoPlayerSection/ProgressSection**: They're not real components
4. **Fix MainContentInner**: Remove usage of deleted hooks
5. **Test Thoroughly**: All features must work after cleanup
