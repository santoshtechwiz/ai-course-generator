# 🚀 Production Deployment Plan: Migration Squashing

## Overview
This plan outlines the safe deployment of squashed migrations to production. The migration squashing consolidates 15 legacy migrations into 2 baseline migrations while preserving all data and relationships.

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Environment Verification
- [ ] **Production database backup completed** (manual verification required)
- [ ] **Staging environment tested** (if available)
- [ ] **Local testing completed** (58 tables, 76 FKs, badge seeding verified)
- [ ] **Application build successful** (TypeScript compilation passed)
- [ ] **Migration files committed** to version control

### ✅ Team Coordination
- [ ] **Deployment window scheduled** (off-peak hours recommended)
- [ ] **Rollback plan communicated** to team
- [ ] **Monitoring alerts configured** for post-deployment
- [ ] **Support team notified** of potential brief service interruption

### ✅ Infrastructure Ready
- [ ] **Database connection strings verified**
- [ ] **Application deployment pipeline ready**
- [ ] **Monitoring dashboards configured**
- [ ] **Log aggregation enabled**

## 🎯 Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Final Verification (15 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Verify current production state
npx prisma migrate status

# 2. Confirm backup exists
# (Manual verification - check backup logs)

# 3. Test application health
curl -f https://your-domain.com/api/health
```

### Phase 2: Migration Deployment (5 minutes)
```bash
# Deploy application with new migration files
# (Use your standard deployment pipeline)

# Apply migrations to production
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Phase 3: Validation (15 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Verify migration status
npx prisma migrate status
# Expected: "Database schema is up to date!"

# 2. Check table count
# (Via database admin tool or API)
# Expected: 58+ tables

# 3. Verify foreign keys
# (Via database admin tool)
# Expected: 76+ foreign key constraints

# 4. Test core functionality
curl -f https://your-domain.com/api/health
curl -f https://your-domain.com/api/categories  # Test DB queries
```

### Phase 4: Application Restart (5 minutes)
```bash
# Restart application servers
# (Use your standard restart procedure)

# Verify application starts successfully
curl -f https://your-domain.com/
```

## 🔍 Validation Checklist

### Database Integrity
- [ ] **Migration status:** Shows "Database schema is up to date!"
- [ ] **Table count:** 58+ tables exist
- [ ] **Foreign keys:** 76+ constraints active
- [ ] **Data preservation:** No data loss in existing tables

### Application Functionality
- [ ] **Health check:** `/api/health` returns 200
- [ ] **Core APIs:** Categories, courses, user auth working
- [ ] **Database queries:** No timeout or connection errors
- [ ] **User login:** Authentication system functional

### Business Logic
- [ ] **Badge system:** Quiz type badges seeded correctly
- [ ] **Ordering quizzes:** Tables created and accessible
- [ ] **User data:** Profiles, progress, subscriptions intact
- [ ] **Relationships:** All foreign key relationships working

## 🚨 Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes)
If critical issues detected within first 15 minutes:

```bash
# 1. Stop application servers
# (Immediate to prevent further issues)

# 2. Restore database from backup
# (Use your backup restoration procedure)

# 3. Revert code deployment
# (Deploy previous version)

# 4. Restart application servers
```

### Delayed Rollback (15-60 minutes)
If issues detected after initial validation:

```bash
# 1. Mark migrations as applied (if needed)
npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 20241031_baseline_schema_only
npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 20241031_data_migrations

# 2. Restore from backup if data corruption detected

# 3. Application restart
```

### Emergency Rollback (> 60 minutes)
If major issues require full restoration:

```bash
# 1. Complete database restoration from backup
# 2. Code rollback to previous version
# 3. Full application restart
# 4. User communication about temporary issues
```

## 📊 Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
- ✅ **Zero data loss** - All user data preserved
- ✅ **Zero downtime** - Service remains available
- ✅ **Zero errors** - No application crashes or 5xx errors
- ✅ **Full functionality** - All features work as expected

### Performance Benchmarks
- ✅ **Response times** - API latency within normal ranges
- ✅ **Database queries** - No slow queries or timeouts
- ✅ **Memory usage** - No unusual spikes
- ✅ **Error rates** - Remain at baseline levels

### Business Impact

---

## ⚠️ Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- **Schema compatibility** - All existing code works with new schema
- **Data preservation** - No destructive operations
- **Backward compatibility** - All APIs and relationships maintained

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- **Migration execution time** - Large schema creation may take time
- **Lock conflicts** - Brief table locks during migration
- **Connection timeouts** - Temporary connection issues possible

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Deploy during low-traffic** - Minimize user impact
- **Monitor closely** - Watch for errors during deployment
- **Quick rollback** - Backup and rollback procedures ready
- **Staged deployment** - Deploy to subset of servers first if possible

## 📈 Monitoring Plan

### Pre-Deployment
- Database connection pool status
- Application response times
- Error rates and logs

### During Deployment
- Migration execution logs
- Database lock status
- Application health checks

### Post-Deployment (24 hours)
