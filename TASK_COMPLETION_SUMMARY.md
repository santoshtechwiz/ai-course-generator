- Handles data transformation and event handling
- Auto-advances on correct answer
- Provides retry functionality
- Tracks time spent on questions

#### 3. Unified Submission Endpoint ✅

- No longer uses separate `/api/ordering-quizzes/submit` endpoint
- Aligns with MCQ and Code quiz patterns
- Single submission pipeline for all quiz types

#### 4. API Route Enhancement ✅
- Added 'ordering' to validation logic (treated like MCQ/Code)
- Added 'ordering' case to processing switch statement
- Uses client-provided isCorrect flag
- Properly processes and stores ordering quiz attempts

#### 5. Redux Slice Update ✅

### Key Benefits

✅ **No Separate Service Posting**
- Ordering quizzes no longer POST to separate endpoint
- Uses same unified path as MCQ and Code quizzes
- Single submission pipeline ensures consistency

✅ **Feature Parity**
- Ordering quizzes inherit all QuizPlayLayout features:
  - Progress tracking
  - Timer with controls
  - Fullscreen mode
  - Focus mode
  - Related quizzes sidebar
  - Error handling
  - And more...

✅ **Consistency**
- Same submission format as other quiz types
- Same validation logic
- Same data storage
- Same processing pipeline

✅ **Maintainability**
- No duplicate code paths
- Single source of truth for quiz processing
- Easier to maintain and extend

✅ **Type Safety**
- QuizType already included 'ordering'
- Full TypeScript support
- No type casting needed

### Submission Flow Alignment

**Before (Separate)**:
```
OrderingQuiz → /api/ordering-quizzes/submit
MCQ/Code → /api/quizzes/[type]/[slug]/submit
```

**After (Unified)** ✅:
```
OrderingQuiz → /api/quizzes/ordering/[slug]/submit
MCQ/Code → /api/quizzes/[type]/[slug]/submit
All same endpoint pattern!
```

### Verification

All changes have been:
- ✅ Implemented
- ✅ Verified in source code

### Backward Compatibility

✅ **Maintained**:
- Old ordering quiz creation flow still works
- OrderingQuiz component unchanged
- OrderingQuizWrapper still functions
- Database schema unchanged
- Existing quiz records unaffected

⚠️ **Deprecated** (but functional):
- `/api/ordering-quizzes/submit` endpoint still exists but no longer used

### Testing Recommendations

1. Load an ordering quiz in dashboard
2. Verify QuizPlayLayout controls are visible
3. Submit correct answer and verify auto-advance
4. Submit incorrect answer and verify retry works
5. Check Network tab to verify endpoint: `/api/quizzes/ordering/[slug]/submit`
6. Verify quiz attempt is recorded in database
7. Check results page displays correctly

### Performance Impact

✅ **Neutral to Positive**:
- Single endpoint instead of branched logic
- Shared validation (no duplication)
- Shared processing (no duplication)
- Reduced codebase complexity

### Code Quality

✅ **Improved**:
- No code duplication
- Consistent patterns
- Single responsibility
- Better maintainability
- Clearer intent
