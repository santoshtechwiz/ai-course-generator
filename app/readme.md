# Quiz Module Refactoring Changelog

## Overview

This refactoring centralizes quiz logic, improves error handling, enhances testing, and standardizes guest user handling across all quiz types. The changes maintain backward compatibility with the existing API while modernizing the internal architecture.

## Key Changes

### State Management
- Migrated from mixed Context/localStorage to Redux-based state management
- Created a central quiz slice with standardized actions and reducers
- Maintained backward compatibility through the QuizContext wrapper

### Utility Functions
- Extracted common logic into reusable utility modules:
  - `quiz-performance.ts`: Score calculation, formatting, and performance metrics
  - `quiz-options.ts`: Option shuffling, validation, and similarity checking
  - `quiz-validation.ts`: Input validation and garbage detection
  - `quiz-error-handling.ts`: Standardized error handling and recovery

### Error Handling
- Implemented comprehensive error handling with recovery strategies
- Added fallback mechanisms for critical operations
- Standardized error types and messages

### Testing
- Added unit tests for Redux slice, hooks, and utility functions
- Improved test coverage for edge cases
- Standardized mocking approach

### Guest User Handling
- Implemented consistent approach for guest users across all quiz types
- Improved guest sign-in prompt with standardized UI
- Added clear separation between guest and authenticated user flows

## Migration Notes

### For Developers
- No changes required for components using the QuizContext
- The QuizProvider API remains unchanged
- All existing hooks, context providers, action names, and selectors continue to work as before

### Internal Changes
- Quiz state is now managed by Redux instead of React Context directly
- localStorage usage is now centralized in the Redux middleware
- Authentication status is tracked in Redux state
- Logic is separated from UI components

## Future Improvements
- Further optimize performance with memoization
- Add more comprehensive analytics tracking
- Implement offline support with service workers
- Enhance accessibility features
