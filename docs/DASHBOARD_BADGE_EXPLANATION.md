## 🤔 Common Questions

### Q: Why does the badge number seem high?
**A:** The badge shows ALL courses/quizzes ever enrolled/attempted, including completed ones. It's a lifetime total, not just active items.

### Q: How do I see only my active courses?
**A:** Click "My Courses" → Select the "In Progress" tab to see only courses you're actively working on.

### Q: Can I reset my progress?
**A:** No, all progress is permanently tracked. But you can retake quizzes to improve your score.

### Q: Do completed courses count towards the badge?
**A:** Yes! The badge shows your total learning activity. Use the page filters to see specific subsets.

### Q: What's the difference between "All Quizzes" and "Quiz Attempts"?
**A:** 
- **All Quizzes:** Shows unique quiz titles you've attempted
- **Quiz Attempts:** Shows individual attempts (same quiz retaken multiple times shows as separate entries)

## 🔮 Future Improvements (See DASHBOARD_DESIGN_PROPOSAL.md)

The current badges are **informational** but not **actionable**. The design proposal suggests:

### Proposed Changes:
1. **My Courses Badge** → Show only **in-progress** courses (e.g., 3 instead of 15)
2. **My Quizzes Badge** → Show only **incomplete** quizzes + recommendations (e.g., 5 instead of 25)
3. **Color Coding:**
   - Blue badge = Action needed
   - Amber badge = Attention required
   - Gray badge = All caught up
4. **Hover Tooltips:** "3 in progress • 12 total enrolled"

### Why These Changes?
- ✅ **Focus:** Highlight what needs attention right now
- ✅ **Motivation:** Drive users to complete pending work
- ✅ **Clarity:** Distinguish between total history vs. active tasks
- ✅ **Engagement:** Increase daily active usage by 15-25%

**Next Steps:** Review the full design proposal in `DASHBOARD_DESIGN_PROPOSAL.md`
