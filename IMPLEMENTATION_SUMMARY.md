# 🎯 Credit Preservation Fix - Implementation Summary

## ✅ **COMPLETED**: All Users Now Preserve Credits on Sign-In

### Problem Fixed
Users (FREE and PAID) were losing credits when signing in after signing out because:
1. JWT callback wasn't fetching existing DB data on initial sign-in
2. Session callback used `||` instead of `??`, treating 0 as falsy
3. SignIn event was overwriting existing users with defaults

---

## 📝 Files Modified

### 1. **lib/auth.ts** (NextAuth Configuration)
**Changes:**
- ✅ JWT callback now fetches existing user data from DB on EVERY sign-in
- ✅ Uses null coalescing (`??`) to preserve actual DB values including 0
- ✅ Session callback updated to use `??` instead of `||`
- ✅ SignIn event checks if user exists before initializing credits
- ✅ Only brand NEW users get default 3 credits, existing users preserved

**Lines Modified:** 90-170 (callbacks section)

### 2. **modules/auth/providers/AuthProvider.tsx**
**Changes:**
- ✅ Updated user object builder to use `??` instead of `||` for credits
- ✅ Preserves 0 credit values correctly

**Lines Modified:** 60-76 (user object memo)

### 3. **modules/subscription/providers/SubscriptionProvider.tsx**
**Status:** ✅ Already correct, no changes needed
- Already uses proper null coalescing
- Already preserves session state

## 🔍 Key Technical Fixes

### Fix #1: Null Coalescing Operator
```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE (treats 0 as falsy)
const credits = user.credits || 3  // 0 becomes 3!

// ✅ AFTER (preserves 0)
const credits = user.credits ?? 3  // 0 stays 0!
```

### Fix #2: Always Fetch DB Data on Sign-In
```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE
if (user) {
  token.credits = user.credits || 3  // Uses session default
}

// ✅ AFTER
if (user) {
  const dbUser = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id: user.id } })
  token.credits = dbUser.credits ?? 3  // Uses DB value first
}
```

### Fix #3: Guard New User Initialization
```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE
if (isNewUser) {
  await prisma.user.update({ credits: 3 })  // Overwrites everyone!
}

// ✅ AFTER
const existingUser = await prisma.user.findUnique(...)
if (isNewUser && (!existingUser || existingUser.credits === null)) {
  await prisma.user.update({ credits: 3 })  // Only truly new users
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Test Case 1: Existing FREE User with Credits
```
1. Initial: User has 5 credits, 2 used (3 remaining)
2. Action: Sign out → Sign in
3. Expected: Still has 5 credits, 2 used (3 remaining)
4. Status: ✅ SHOULD WORK
```

### Test Case 2: Existing FREE User with 0 Credits
```
1. Initial: User has 0 credits, 5 used (0 remaining)
2. Action: Sign out → Sign in
3. Expected: Still has 0 credits, 5 used (0 remaining)
4. Status: ✅ SHOULD WORK (0 preserved, not reset to 3)
```

### Test Case 3: Existing PAID Subscriber
```
1. Initial: User has 100 credits, 20 used (PRO plan)
2. Action: Sign out → Sign in
3. Expected: Still has 100 credits, 20 used, PRO plan
4. Status: ✅ SHOULD WORK
```

### Test Case 4: Brand NEW User
```
1. Initial: First time signing up
2. Action: Sign up with Google/GitHub
3. Expected: Gets 3 credits, 0 used (FREE plan)
4. Status: ✅ SHOULD WORK
```

## 🛠️ Verification Tools

### 1. Browser Console Test
```javascript
// Open browser console and paste:
(async () => {
  const res = await fetch('/api/auth/session');
  const session = await res.json();
  console.log('Credits:', session.user.credits);
  console.log('Used:', session.user.creditsUsed);
  console.log('Remaining:', session.user.credits - session.user.creditsUsed);
})();
```

### 2. Run Test Script
```bash
# In your browser after signing in:
# Open DevTools Console → Network tab → Copy test script
node test-credit-preservation.js
```

### 3. Database Verification
```bash
# Check all users' credits
node verify-credits-db.js

# Check specific user
node verify-credits-db.js user@example.com
```

### 4. SQL Query
```sql
-- Check user credits in database
SELECT 
  email,
  credits,
  "creditsUsed",
  "userType",
  "lastActiveAt"
FROM "User"
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Before Deploying
- [x] Code changes applied
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes (no errors)
- [ ] Test with existing FREE user
- [ ] Test with existing PAID user
- [ ] Test with brand new sign-up
- [ ] Verify database has correct values

### After Deploying to Staging
- [ ] Run test script in browser console
- [ ] Sign out/in multiple times
- [ ] Check server logs for "preserving credits" messages
- [ ] Verify no JWT/session errors

### Before Production
- [ ] All staging tests pass
- [ ] Database backup created
- [ ] Rollback plan ready
- [ ] Monitor Sentry/logging configured

### After Production Deploy
- [ ] Monitor sign-in logs for 24 hours
- [ ] Check for any credit-related support tickets
- [ ] Run `verify-credits-db.js` to audit database
- [ ] Verify no regression in subscription upgrades

## 📊 Expected Console Logs

### On Sign-In (Existing User)
```
[JWT] Fetching existing user data on sign-in
[SignIn] Existing user abc123 signed in - preserving credits: {
  credits: 5,
  used: 2,
  plan: 'FREE'
}
```

### On Sign-In (New User)
```
[JWT] Fetching existing user data on sign-in
[SignIn] New user xyz789 - initializing with default credits
```

## 🔄 Rollback Instructions

If issues occur, revert changes:

```bash
# Revert auth configuration
git checkout HEAD~1 -- lib/auth.ts

# Revert auth provider
git checkout HEAD~1 -- modules/auth/providers/AuthProvider.tsx

# Restart application
npm run build
npm run start
```

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Issue: User reports credits still resetting
**Check:**
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Check database: `SELECT * FROM "User" WHERE email = 'user@example.com'`
3. Check server logs for JWT errors
4. Verify Prisma client is updated: `npx prisma generate`

### Issue: New users not getting default credits
**Check:**
1. Database migration ran: `npx prisma migrate deploy`
2. Default values in schema: `credits Int? @default(3)`
3. SignIn event logs show initialization

### Issue: Paid subscribers losing subscription
**Check:**
1. Subscription table data intact
2. JWT callback fetching subscription relation
3. Session includes `subscriptionPlan` and `subscriptionStatus`

## 📈 Monitoring Queries

### Count users with NULL credits (should be 0)
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "User" WHERE credits IS NULL;
```

### Count users who signed in today
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "User" 
WHERE "lastActiveAt" > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day';
```

### Average credits by user type
```sql
SELECT 
  "userType",
  COUNT(*) as users,
  AVG(credits) as avg_credits,
  AVG("creditsUsed") as avg_used
FROM "User"
GROUP BY "userType";
```

---
