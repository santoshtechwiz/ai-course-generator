# Quiz Result Sign-in Flow Bug Fix

## Problem Statement

**Bug**: When a user submits a quiz while unauthenticated and then signs in, the quiz results page doesn't load the results. The Redux state shows:

```json
{
  "currentQuestionIndex": 0,
  "answers": {},
  "results": null,  // ❌ Should contain quiz results
  "isCompleted": false,
  "status": "succeeded",
  "error": null
}
```

## Root Cause

The `QuizResultHandler` component had a race condition in its initialization logic:

1. **Initial render** with `isAuthenticated = false` → Component sets `hasInitialized.current = true`
2. **User signs in** → `isAuthenticated` changes to `true`
3. **Component re-renders** → `hasInitialized.current` is still `true`, so it skips checking for temp results
4. **Result**: Temp results in localStorage are never loaded

### The Problem Code

```typescript
// ❌ OLD CODE - Buggy
useEffect(() => {
  if (!slug || isAuthLoading || hasInitialized.current) return
  hasInitialized.current = true  // Set too early, blocks reload on auth change
  
  // ... initialization logic
}, [slug, isAuthLoading, ...])
```

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Initialization Logic

The fix ensures that when authentication state changes and temp results exist, the component resets its initialization state to trigger a reload:

```typescript
// ✅ NEW CODE - Fixed
useEffect(() => {
  if (!slug || isAuthLoading) return  // Removed hasInitialized check here
  
  // Check for temp results BEFORE checking hasInitialized
  const tempResults = storageManager.getTempQuizResults(slug, quizType)
  if (tempResults && !tempResultsLoadedRef.current) {
    tempResultsLoadedRef.current = true
    
    if (isAuthenticated) {
      // User is authenticated - save temp results to DB
      setViewState('calculating')
      dispatch(loadTempResultsAndSave({ slug, quizType }))
    } else {
      // User not authenticated - show sign-in prompt
      dispatch(setQuizResults(tempResults.results))
      setViewState('showSignin')
    }
    hasInitialized.current = true
    return
  }
  
  // Set hasInitialized AFTER temp results check
  if (hasInitialized.current) {
    // Already initialized, just update view state
    if (hasResults) {
      if (isAuthenticated && viewState !== 'showResults') {
        setViewState('showResults')
      } else if (!isAuthenticated && viewState !== 'showSignin') {
        setViewState('showSignin')
      }
    }
    return
  }
  
  hasInitialized.current = true
  // ... rest of initialization
}, [slug, isAuthLoading, ...])
```

### 2. Added Auth Change Detection

A separate effect detects when user becomes authenticated and triggers a reload if temp results exist:

```typescript
// ✅ NEW CODE - Auth change handler
useEffect(() => {
  if (isAuthLoading) return

  // When user becomes authenticated and we have temp results, trigger reload
  if (isAuthenticated && !hasResults) {
    const tempResults = storageManager.getTempQuizResults(slug, quizType)
    if (tempResults && !tempResultsLoadedRef.current) {
      console.log('[QuizResultHandler] User authenticated with temp results, reloading')
      hasInitialized.current = false // Reset to trigger reload
      tempResultsLoadedRef.current = false
    }
  }
}, [isAuthenticated, hasResults, isAuthLoading, slug, quizType])
```

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests (`__tests__/components/quiz-result-handler.test.tsx`)

1. **BUG FIX: loads temp results when user returns from sign-in**
   - Simulates the complete flow: unauthenticated submission → sign-in → return
   - Verifies temp results are loaded and saved to DB
   - Verifies results are displayed correctly

2. **Handles expired temp results gracefully**
   - Tests that results older than 24 hours are ignored

3. **Handles API failure when saving temp results**
   - Ensures temp results are NOT cleared on API failure (user can retry)

4. **Clears temp results after successful save**
   - Verifies cleanup after successful DB save

5. **Does not reload results multiple times**
   - Prevents infinite loops and duplicate API calls

6. **Handles mismatched quiz slug correctly**
   - Clears old results when viewing different quiz

7. **Shows loading state during authentication check**
   - Prevents premature loading while auth state is unknown

8. **Authenticated user without temp results loads from API**
   - Normal flow for returning users

### Integration Tests (`__tests__/integration/quiz-signin-flow.test.ts`)

1. **Complete flow: unauthenticated submission → sign-in → results loaded**
   - End-to-end test of the entire user journey

2. **Temp results expire after 24 hours**
   - Tests TTL expiration logic

3. **Multiple quiz results can be stored independently**
   - Tests isolation between different quizzes

4. **Corrupted temp results are handled gracefully**
   - Tests error recovery

5. **Different quiz types store results separately**
   - Tests MCQ, OpenEnded, Code, etc. isolation

6. **Results with all correct/incorrect answers**
   - Edge case testing

7. **localStorage quota exceeded is handled gracefully**
   - Tests storage error handling

8. **Concurrent saves to different quizzes work correctly**
   - Tests race condition handling

## Monitoring

Added comprehensive console logging with `[QuizResultHandler]` prefix for debugging:

```typescript
console.log('[QuizResultHandler] Initializing for slug:', slug, 'isAuthenticated:', isAuthenticated)
console.log('[QuizResultHandler] Found temp results, isAuthenticated:', isAuthenticated)
console.log('[QuizResultHandler] User authenticated with temp results, reloading')
```

These logs help track the component's state transitions and identify any future issues.
