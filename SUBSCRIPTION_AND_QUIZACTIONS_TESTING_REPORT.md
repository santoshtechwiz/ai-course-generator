## 🔧 Section 3: Code Quality Findings

### **Console Statements Found (Cleanup Required)**

⚠️ **Issue:** 2 console.log debug statements found in QuizActions.tsx

#### **Location 1: Lines 607-614 (secondaryActions debug)**
```tsx
console.log('QuizActions Debug:', {
  isOwner,
  isAuthenticated,
  showPdfGeneration,
  deleteShowCondition: isOwner && isAuthenticated,
  variant,
  secondaryActions: actions.map(a => ({ key: a.key, show: a.show }))
})
```
**Impact:** Development-only debug log exposing component state  
**Recommendation:** Remove entire console.log block  
**Priority:** MEDIUM (not visible to users, but clutters production logs)

---

#### **Location 2: Lines 727-733 (DropdownMenu debug)**
```tsx
console.log('DropdownMenu rendering:', {
  totalSecondaryActions: secondaryActions.length,
  visibleActions: visibleActions.length,
  visibleActionKeys: visibleActions.map(a => a.key)
})
```
**Impact:** Development-only debug log showing action visibility  
**Recommendation:** Remove entire console.log block  
**Priority:** MEDIUM (not visible to users, but clutters production logs)

---

### **Security Validation (Multi-Layer Approach)**

✅ **Layer 1: Client-Side Authentication Check**
- **Code:** Lines 115-128 (`canPerformAction` function)
- **Validates:** User must be authenticated (`isAuthenticated && user`)
- **Feedback:** Toast error "Please sign in to perform this action"

✅ **Layer 2: Client-Side Ownership Check**
- **Code:** Line 86 (`isOwner` computation)
- **Validates:** `user.id === props.userId`
- **Feedback:** Toast error "You don't have permission to perform this action"

✅ **Layer 3: Client-Side Subscription Check**
- **Code:** Line 69 (`useFeatureAccess('pdf-generation')`)
- **Validates:** User subscription tier includes feature
- **Feedback:** Shows `SubscriptionUpgradeModal` with required plan

✅ **Layer 4: Server-Side Validation**
- **Code:** Lines 162-166, 195-199, 228-232 (API calls with `credentials: 'include'`)
- **Validates:** Server-side auth, ownership, and subscription checks
- **Feedback:** API returns 401/403 errors if unauthorized

**Assessment:** ✅ **Excellent security architecture** - defense in depth with multiple validation layers

   - Remove QuizActions debug logs
   - Search codebase for remaining console statements
   - Use linter to prevent future console logs

3. **Server-Side Validation (Verify)**
   - Confirm API endpoints validate ownership
   - Confirm API endpoints validate subscription
   - Test unauthorized access attempts

4. **Monitoring Setup (Recommended)**
   - Track subscription conversion rates
