## 🚀 **All Requested Changes Completed Successfully**

### ✅ **1. Fixed Import Error**

**Solution**: 
- Changed `import { store } from "@/store/hooks"` 
- To `import { store } from "@/store"`
**Result**: Application compiles without errors

### ✅ **2. Completely Removed Theater Mode**

**Benefits**:
